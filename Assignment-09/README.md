1.  The difference between Universal, element, class, and id is the amount of information they
are changing.  If you have several different attributes for the same element you may use an ID to help keep this organized.
2.  I chose Pastel green, Brick red, and gold for my colors representing the 1960s.
their hexcodes are #77DD77,  #CB4154, and #FFD700.
3.  I had a bit harder of a time on this one as the tutorial didn't explain quite as much and
I had to do a little more creative work and check the website for how to do what I wanted to.
