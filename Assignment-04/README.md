1. I went to http://ubl.com/ it looked very simple and childish in a way.  It seemed like there wasn't too much effort involved in the making of the website.  It has changed a lot in that now it is much cleaner and more professional looking.

2. The GIT module is pretty easy to understand and I am excited to move foward and figure out what to use it for.
