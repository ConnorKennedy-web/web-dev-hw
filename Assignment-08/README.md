1.  Learning HTML in this class was completely new for me because I have no
experience in this kind of stuff.  The tutorials helped me a lot so I didn't find
anything too difficult but I found it very satisfying when the code worked!

2.  I am excited to start learning how to make my websites look more better and
more professional now that I know basics of HTML.

3.  This work cycle was basically the same as the other ones. I watched the
tutorial to get the basic structure down and then looked at my old projects
to fill in the required material.
