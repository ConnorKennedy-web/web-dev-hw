#Assignment 5
##Connor Kennedy


1. Pages usually have 1 head and 1 body element and the head element stores all the information and runs first to show the body elements on the page.

2. Structural markup structures the page layout while semantic is markup where the name of tag indicates something about the information.

3. This assignment was really satisfying to work on, checking my progress as I went. I feel that I am starting to get a etter understanding of this stuff!
