        <h1>Learn About Space</h1>

        <p>Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system and has an average surface
          temperature of around 450Â° C. Did you know that Venus isn't the closest planet
          to the sun?  That is Mercury.  You would think that Mercury would then be the
          hottest, but Mercury has no atmosphere (which regulates temperature), resulting
          in big fluctuations. </p>

        <p>The Sun accounts for 99.86% of the mass in our solar system with a mass of around
          330,000 times that of Earth. Did you know that the Sun is made up of mostly hydrogen
          (three quarters worth) with the rest of its mass attributed to helium.
          If the Sun had a voice would it be high and squeaky from all that helium?</p>

        <p>The universe extends far beyond our own galaxy, The Milky Way,
          which is why scientists can only estimate how many stars are in space.
          However, scientists estimate the universe contains approximately
          1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars, or a septillion.
          While no one can actually count every single grain of sand on the earth,
          the estimated total from researchers at the University of Hawaii, is somewhere
          around seven quintillion, five hundred quadrillion grains.  That is an awfully
          big sand castle!</p>

        <p>Venus has a slow axis rotation which takes 243 Earth days to complete its day.
          The orbit of Venus around the Sun is 225 Earth days, making a year on Venus 18 days
          less than a day on Venus.</p>
