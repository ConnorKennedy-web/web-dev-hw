## Final Assignment

1.  I learned a lot and almost everything in this course was new to me but I had a lot of fun and mainly learned that it can be easier than i had previously thought to make a website!
2.  Everything I learned in this course about design was new to me as well but I had a lot of fun messing with colors and how to changes positions of objects.
3.  I took a lot of code from my previous assignments as you can tell my final assignment is similar to assignment 12. But I added different colors and a functioning menu bar with many different pages!
